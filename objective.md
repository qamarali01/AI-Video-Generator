Peppo AI Engineering Internship – Technical Challenge
Objective:
 Demonstrate your ability to build and deploy an AI-integrated application in the cloud.
 We want to see how you handle model integration, prompt engineering, cloud deployment, and code quality.

Problem Statement
Build a minimal AI video generation web app that:
Takes a user prompt as input (text box).


Generates a short video (5–10 seconds) based on the prompt using any AI API or open-source model you prefer (e.g., Pika Labs, Runway, Stability AI, OpenAI’s image→video pipelines, etc.).


Displays the generated video in the browser.


Deploys the app to a public cloud using vercel



Requirements
Frontend: Can be minimal — HTML/CSS/JS or React/Vue/Svelte.


Backend: Python (FastAPI/Flask) or Node.js.


Deployment: Public URL required (no localhost demos).


README: Clear setup instructions, dependencies, and API key configuration.


Use .env or secure methods for API keys (do not commit keys to GitHub).

Evaluation Rubric (100 points)
Criteria
Description
Weight
Functionality
App works end-to-end: takes prompt → generates → displays video.

Deployment
Public cloud deployment is stable and loads without errors.
20
Code Quality
Readable, well-structured, commented, and follows good practices.
15
Documentation
README is clear, concise, and explains setup/deployment.
10
Innovation
Any enhancements: extra features, better UI, caching, prompt improvements, RAG-based context injection, etc.

Pro Tips
Keep it minimal but functional — don’t over-engineer.


Focus on getting something live rather than perfect.


If APIs are slow/limited, mock with a placeholder video + logs but explain how you’d handle production.


Bonus points for video streaming optimizations or RAG-style prompt improvements.
